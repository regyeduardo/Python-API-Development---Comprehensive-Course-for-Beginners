## Databases
### What is a database
- Database is a collection of organized data that can be easaly accessed and managed

### DBMS
- We don't work or interact with databases directly
- Instead we make use of a software referred to as a Database Management System(DBMS)

### Popular DBMS 2:25:30
| Relational | NoSQL      |
|------------|------------|
| MySQL      | MongoDB    |
| PostgreSQL | DynamoDB   |
| Oracle     | Oracle     |
| SQL Server | SQL Server |

### Ralational Database & SQL
- Structured Query Languege(SQL) - Language used to cummunicate with DBMS

### Postgres
- Each instance of postgres can be carved into multiple separete databases
- By Default every Postgres installation comes with one database already created called "postgres"
- This is important because Postgres requires you to specify the name of a database to make a connection. So there needs to always be one database

### Tables
- A table represents a subject or event in an application

### Columns Vs Rows
- A table is made up of columns and rows
- Each Column represents a different attribute
- Each row represents a different entry in the table

### Postgres DataTypes
- Databases have datatypes just like any programming language
| DataType | Postgres                | Python     |
|----------|-------------------------|------------|
| Numeric  | int, decimal, precision | Int, float |
| Text     | Varchar, text           | string     |
| Bool     | boolean                 | boolean    |
| Sequence | array                   | list       |

### Primary Key
- Is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table
- Table can have one and only one primary key

### Unique Constraints
- A UNIQUE constraint can be applied to any column to make sure every record has a unique value for that column

### Null Constraints
- By default, when adding a new entry to a database, any column can be left blank. When a column is left blank, it has a null value
- If you need column to be properly filled in to create a new record, a NOT NULL constraint can be added to yhe column to ensure that the column is never left blank

## Object Relational Mapper(ORM) 4:31:24
- Layer of obstraction that sits between the database and us
- We can perform all database operations through traditional python code. No more SQL!

### What can ORMs Do
- Instead of manually defining tables in postgres, we can define our tables as python models
- Queries can be made exclusively through python code. No SQL is necessary
```python
class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = "posts"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    title = Column(String, index=True, nullable=False)
    content = Column(String, nullable=False)
    published = Column(Boolean)
```
```python
db.query(models.Post).filter(models.Post.id == id).first()
```

### SQLALCHEMY
- SQLALCHEMY is one of the most popular python ORMs
- It is stand-alone library and has no association with FastAPI, It can be used with any other python web frameworks or any python based application
